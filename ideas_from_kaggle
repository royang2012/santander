* Right now there are too many features! some possible ways of dealing with it:
  1. use feature importance to filter out least important features
  2. drop unrelavant product history
  3. someone say that the date has something to do with products added, so maybe add date to the feature list

* someone say that the customer info keeps the same all the time

* someone say that most customers comes from ES, so 'pais_residencia' should be deleted

* 1211 out of 980844 has 'indrel' = 1

* Most of the customers have their birth country different than the bank country

* add total number of products as a feature
